# UnixScreenSaver
A Mac screen saver counting showing binary unix time with a fancy day/night image thing.
Kinda looks like this.

You can choose any image you want, can have the whole thing mirrored on both sides if you prefer, and can have the current time in your favorite format in the corner.

## Disclaimer
Please don't use this on an OLED display or any other display where it could cause burn-in. The point of it is that some elements only change on massive timescales, which is cool but not great for saving screens.

## Installation
Dowload and build the repository yourself, or use the included BarCodeBinaryScreenSaver.saver file. Drop this file into the system `/Library/Screen\ Savers/` folder. You should now see the Screen Saver in System Settings. If not, restart System Settings.

## Settings
In System Settings, you can mess with the screen saver settings in the Config panel.
